# Code taboo

## Story

Imagine that you work in a software developer team and it's like the Tower of
Babel: you hardly understand each other because when you say "go through that
thingy" the other party doesn't know what you are talking about. So you decide
to improve your tech language skills with an exercise.

As the title suggests, it is code and taboo in the same time :) Let's play "who
can explain their code to the other"!

## What are you going to learn?

- Tech language above all
- Active listening
- Coding

## Tasks

1. Form pairs (if a group has odd number of members then one team can have three members or a mentor can join). One of you will be the *explainer*, the other one the *explainee*. The explainer should explain the contents of the 1st algorithm with proper tech language to let the other know what it does. The explainee should open an IDE and without looking at each other's screen should try to recreate the code in the file `my_algorithm.py`. In the end the explainee should run the code to test and fix it if necessary. At the end of the round try to understand together what the code does and the explainee should write it down in bullet points into `my_algorithm_description.txt`. All changes should be committed and pushed into the repository. The round can take at most 45mins.
    - Students formed pairs
    - One member (explainer) opened the first algorithm and explained to the other with proper tech language
    - Other member (explainee) could recreate the algorithm and it has run successfully
    - Explainee has committed the changes (s)he made into `my_algorithm.py` and pushed them into the remote repository
    - Together the pair could summarize the behavior/goal of the code and it is written in the `my_algorithm_description.txt` file that is committed and pushed into the repository
    - Neither student could see the other's screen during the activity
    - Suggested time frame was not exceeded

2. Change roles (who was the explainer now becomes the explainee and vice versa) and do the exercise again. The explainer should explain the contents of the 2nd algorithm with proper tech language to let the other know what it does. other one the *explainee*. Remember, not to look at each other's screen. The explainee should save the code in the file `my_algorithm.py`. At the end of the round try to understand together what the code does and the explainee should write it down in bullet points into `my_algorithm_description.txt`. All changes should be committed and pushed into the repository. The round can take at most 45mins.
    - Students changed roles
    - One member (explainer) opened the second algorithm and explained to the other with proper tech language
    - Other member (explainee) could recreate the algorithm and it has run successfully
    - Explainee has committed the changes (s)he made into `my_algorithm.py` and pushed them into the remote repository
    - Together the pair could summarize the behavior/goal of the code and it is written in the `my_algorithm_description.txt` file that is committed and pushed into the repository
    - Neither student could see the other's screen during the activity
    - Suggested time frame was not exceeded

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- It is only fun when you don't look at anothers' screen
- **Explainer**: Your task is to explain your code to your pair in a way when
  you don't dictate your code but use proper tech language to read what your
  code does. So you must not use reserved words e.g. `for`, `while`, `if` and
  things like semicolon, indentation etc. (of course if you explain in English
  you can say "we remove elements from the list while it has any" but don't say
  "create a while loop which condition is..."). So the point is to transfer the
  meaning of the code not the actual code. Try to use proper tech language as
  much as you can, like "we declare a variable to hold the list of students" or
  "we go through the elements of the list" or "the return value of the function
  will be" etc. In the first 5 minutes try to understand the code, as it will be
  a lot easier to explain if you get the big picture.
- **Explainee**: Your task is to write the code based on your pair's
  explanation. You must not see the code but you can ask questions, but
  remember, your goal is to grasp the meaning of the code not to ask for
  specific details like is it a for loop or not. If you are ready, run your code
  and ask the explainer to do that as well and compare your results. If it's not
  the same, keep asking and explaining until it is.
